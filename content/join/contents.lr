getting-started:
While you may be thinking all about the actual translation, for collaborative project such as translating at the Queerscriptors, it is important to coordinate. So the first step is actually to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tzbXdkxWYF) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#queerscriptors:encryptionin.space).

Once you are on either of those, you can proceed to create an account at our [Weblate](https://weblate.queerscriptors.org), this is the tool we use to translate.
