gettingstarted:
While you may be thinking all about the actual translation, translating at the Queerscriptors is a collaborative effort, and so it is important to coordinate. So the first step is actually to join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/tzbXdkxWYF) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#queerscriptors:encryptionin.space) and talk with people.

Once you are on either of those, you can proceed to step 2, creating an account at our [Weblate](https://weblate.queerscriptors.org), this is the tool we use to translate. If you don't want to, it is possible to create suggestions without an account, but someone with an account then has to accept your suggestion before it actually gets added and we will have a harder time crediting you.
