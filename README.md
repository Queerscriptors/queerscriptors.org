This is the source code for the website [queerscriptors.org](https://queerscriptors.org). It uses [lektor](https://getlektor.com)

It is available from:

- [lab.encryptionin.space](https://lab.encryptionin.space/Queerscriptors/Queerscriptors.org) (canonical)
- [github](https://github.com/queerscriptors/queerscriptors.org)
- [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/queerscriptors/queerscriptors.org)

I do not always visit github and gitlab, so either send me an email (hackerncoder@<canonical without lab.>) or ping me on matrix (or if you use discord, general is bridged to matrix so write there)

Licensing, or what is a website?
This website contains no JavaScript and has essentially no code made by myself, therefore it isn't a program, the GPL or similar licenses do not seem applicable, of course I am not a lawyer.

But, I wish to make this website libre software or whatever is the equivalent. If you know anything about licensing and think this should be made better please reach out to me
