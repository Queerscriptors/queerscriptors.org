Licensing, or what is a website?
This website contains no JavaScript and has essentially no code made by myself, therefore it isn't a program, the GPL or similar licenses do not seem applicable, of course I am not a lawyer.

I wish to use CC-BY 4.0 where applicable, or a similar license for anything it isn't applicable to. If you know anything about licensing and think this should be made better please reach out to me
